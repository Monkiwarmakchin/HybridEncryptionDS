# HybridEncryptionDS

Program that encrypts (using an AES algorithm) and digitally signs (using an RSA algorithm) text files (and probably more types of files), producing
a secure .txt for transmission on any channel, since only the same program can decrypt, with the correct keys,
the encrypted file for the receiver.

Accompanied by a really extensive research and development report.
